I want my world to be fun.No parents, no rules, no nothing. Like, no one can stop me. No one can stop me.
I'm looking forward to influencing others in a positive way. My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it.
A girl has to have a beautiful smile, beautiful eyes and she should have a good sense of humor. She should be honest, loving and trustworthy.
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

[Pre-chorus:]
So, we fight, so, we fight through the hurt, through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, and we live, and we learn, and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus:]
So, it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth,
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth

Mamma, you were always somewhere
And, daddy, I live out of town,
So, tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So, tell me why am I in tears?
Whoa, so far away. And now I just need you here

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again

[Chorus]

Fell so far away
From where we used to be
And now we're standing
And where do we go when there's no road
To get to your heart?
So, let's start over again

[Chorus]

I never thought it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
Love you

The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale (yeah)
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down (no)
Like a see saw lets you down (oh) you know why
Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear,
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby,

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa,
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(don't knock ya earrings) like yesterday
(They shine on me) we were little then
(in class daydreamed about you) my baby
Just remember
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (heart breaker)
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Alright, let's go

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (ya)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl (yeah yea) [2x]
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Only you, shawty (haha)
(It's your chance, take her hand to the floor)
Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready
(Cuz you only got one chance for your first dance)
Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

[Justin:]
When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Usher:]
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
Your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

[Justin:]
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love

'Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you (love me)
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh, your love

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared

And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
You're the common denominator

Before you love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie."
You and I will stand to be love's reply

Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, here, here

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
You're the common denominator

I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'
I'mma hold it down for you, you
You're the common denominator

I don't wanna go back...

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
You're the common denominator

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
Alright let's go)

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl

Il y a des mots qu'aujourd'hui on se dit
Mais qui nous font du tord
Et qui ne valent rien quand on les retient
Et ça rien que pour y croire encore
Tu gardes les mots qui restent intacts
Et les larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Je me tiens devant toi
(I'm coming for you)
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what Im gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Mais ça n'est qu'un souvenir dans ta vie
Il y a trop d'espace entre vous
Même les heures passées à toujours penser
Ne servent à rien après tout
Et tellement de mots perdus sur des pages
Et des larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Ohh (Oh Oh)
Aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all i see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
Ohh (Oh)
C'est avec toi que je veux être plus que tout
And when you're mine in this world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
Je me tiens devant toi
(I'm coming for you)
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what Im gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Il faut seulement que tu t'en sortes
Il faut que tu passes la porte pour que je te délivre
Tu n'as seulement qu'à le dire plus fort
(Free to fall)
Un peu plus fort
(Fall in love)
Je prie pour qu'aujourd'hui tu commences ta vie
Avec moi je promets
You'll be one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(One less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (One less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Oh whoa [x3]

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh

Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)

For you I'd write a symphony,
I'd tell the violin,
It's time to sink or swim,
Watch them play for ya,
For you I'd be, (whoa oh)
Running a thousand miles,
Just to get to where you are.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,
I'd rather give you the world,
Or we can share mine,
I know I won't be the first one,
giving you all this attention,
Baby listen,

I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,

Every day,
I bring the sun around,
I sweep away the clouds,
Smile for me.

Every second, every single time,
Spend it like my last dime.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,

Or we can share mine,

(With you, with you
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place.)

Now Romeo and Juliet,
Bet they never felt the way we felt.
Bonnie and Clyde,
Never had to hide like we do, we do.
You and I both know it can't work,
It's all fun and games,
'Til someone gets hurt,
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space,
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sonny and Cher,
I don't care, I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop.

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
And I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
(Yeah oh no no no)

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space).
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Oh
Yeah
Mmmm

I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
Cause baby
You smile I smile (oh)
Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile (oh whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey

Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby (hey)
You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
Make me smile baby

Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Hey hey hey

You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
Oh

You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
e's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
Trying to be cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

See my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah, yeah)

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love
Oh, no,
Oh, no, oh

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love, of love, of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug, one last hug, one last hug

There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality, reality, reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand
That it's meant to be.
'Cause, baby, when you're with me...

It's like an angel came by
And took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh, no

So, let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So, baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favourite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear, no fear, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here, are here, are here?

There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor.
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation
By taking a chance and more,
Oh, no, because...

It's like an angel came by
And took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh, no

So, let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So, baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by
And took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh, no

So, take my hand
Let's just dance
Watch my feet
Follow me
Don't be scared,
Girl, I'm here
If you didn't know,
This is love

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Oh, baby
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So, baby, know for sure
That I'll never let you go

So don't fear.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I am here, right here
I'll never let you go

Don't shed a tear.
Whenever you need me,
I'll be here
I'll never let you go

Oh, no, oh, no, oh...
I'll never let you go
Oh, no, oh, no, oh...
I'll never let you go
[Jessica Jarrell:]
It feels like we've been out at sea:
So back and forth – that's how it seems.
And when I wanna talk you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be.

So crazy is this thing we call "love".
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up.
I'm reaching out for you.
Got me out here in the water, and I...

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm overboard,
And I need your love to pull me up.
I can't swim on my own.
It's too much.
Feels like I'm drowning without your love.
So, throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.

Life saver, oh, life saver.
My life saver.
Life saver, oh, life saver.

Never understood you when you'd say
You wanted me to meet you halfway.
I felt like I was doing my part.
You kept thinking you were coming up short.
It's funny how things change 'cause now I see.

So crazy is this thing we call "love".
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up.
I'm reaching out for you.
Got me out here in the water and I...

[Justin Bieber (Jessica Jarrell):]
I'm overboard. (Overboard.)
And I need your love (your love) to pull me up (to pull me up).
I can't swim on my own.
It's too much. (It's too much.)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love (your love).
So, throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.

[Justin Bieber and Jessica Jarrell:]
It's supposed to be some give and take, I know.
But you're only taking and not giving anymore.
So, what do I do? (So, what do I do?)
'Cause I still love you. (Still love you, baby.)
And you're the only one who can save me.

I'm overboard.
And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up).
I can't swim on my own.
It's too much. (It's too much.)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love.
(I'm drowning, baby, I'm drowning.)
So, throw yourself out to me (can't swim), my life saver.

Life saver, oh, life saver.
My life saver.
(It's crazy, crazy, crazy.)
Life saver, oh, life saver.

Life saver, oh, life saver.
My life saver.
Life saver, oh, life saver, yeah.

It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl, oh
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We can make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby, believe me

That we can go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

It's a big big world
And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimmin' in

We can make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, ooh

That we can go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, honestly with the strength of our love

Nowhere but up

Baby, we were underground
We're on the surface now
We're gonna make it, girl

If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Yeah
Nowhere but up
Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
'Til you believe that
That should be me

That should be me

You said you needed a little time
For my mistakes
It's funny how you use that time
To have me replaced

Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
What you doin' to me?
You're takin' him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart
It's working 'cause you know that

That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
'Til you believe that
That should be me

I need to know, should I fight for love or disarm?
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart

That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
'Til you believe that
That should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me
That should be me
Giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me

Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
J-J-J-J-B, yeah, whoa, oh, whoa, no.

Now I can see it, girl.
You ain't gotta say nothing, no.
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do something.
I feel the chemistry.
Yeah, you're into me.
A little kiss is a definite possibility.

Seen you a couple times,
Had a couple conversations.
Since you've been on my mind
Made a couple observations.
Like you're a fly chick.
You could be my chick.
Play by the rules and you can get what I give.

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush.
And what we do keep it just between us.
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B.
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me.

So, baby,
I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this.

So, tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody
That you got me twisted with your lips, girl?
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential,
No one has to do with it
But you and me, girl.
Telling would ruin it.
Don't need that TMZ
All in our privacy.
Use them lips for kissing, girl,
If you wanna ride with me.

And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off.
No problem.
You can go your way,
And I'll go mine,
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah.

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush.
And what we do keep it just between us.
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B.
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me.

So, baby,
I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have (good kiss) you telling everybody (everybody)
You got me all twisted with your lips like this.

So tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody
That you got me twisted with your lips, girl?
Are you gonna kiss and tell, tell?

Said, are you gonna kiss and tell, tell?
Said, are you gonna kiss and tell, tell?
Said, are you gonna kiss and tell, yeah, kiss and tell, oh?

Don't tell your homies.
Don't tell your mama.
Don't tell your girlfriends.
That'll start some drama.
Stay off that Facebook.
I'll treat you real good.
You keep this private,
And you can get what I give.

Baby,
I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody (Everybody knows.)
You got me all twisted with your lips like this

So tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss (kiss), kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody
That you got me twisted with your lips, girl?
Are you gonna kiss and tell, oh, kiss and tell?
Whoa, oh

I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell.

No, no, no.

If you're gonna kiss and tell.
If you're gonna kiss and tell.
That's not me.
Where are you now
When I need you the most?
Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close.

Help me when I am down.
Lift me up off the ground.
Teach me right from wrong.
Help me to stay strong.

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be.
I need you to set me free, yeah.

Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Now, that I'm half-grown?
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone.

Where are you now,
When nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light.

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be.
I need you to set me free, yeah, yeah.

I need you
To need me.
Can't you see me?
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty.
I'm not whole
When you're not with me.

I want you
Here with me
To guide me,
Hold me
And love me now.

Where are you now?
Oh.
Where are you now?
Ooh.

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be, yeah.
I need you to set me free, yeah.

Where are you now?
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh.
Yeah.
(Never say never)
(Pick it up this, pick it up)
Yeah, yeah.
(Pick it up this, pick it up)
Never, never, never, never, never, never.
(Pick it up this, pick it up)

See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never

Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Never say it, never, never say it

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Here we go!
Guess who?
JSmith and JB! (Uh-huh!)
I gotcha little bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
Let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!)

I will never say never! (never say it, never, never say it) (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (OK) (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
And never say never.

It's time to sink or swim,
Watch them play for ya,
For you I'd be, (whoa oh)
Running a thousand miles,
Just to get to where you are.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,
I'd rather give you the world,
Or we can share mine,
I know I won't be the first one,
giving you all this attention,
Baby listen,
I just need somebody to love,
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,

[Usher]
Every day,
I bring the sun around,
I sweep away the clouds,
Smile for me.

Every second, every single time,
Spend it like my last dime.

Anything you want,

Money can't find me,
Somebody to love (oh, oh)
Find me somebody to love (whoah ohh)

I need somebody to love,

Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta

[Justin Bieber:]
You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Kanye West:]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?

[Raekwon:]
Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

[Justin Bieber x2:]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
There's a dream in my soul,
A fire that's deep inside me.
There's a me no one knows,
Waiting to be set free.

I'm gonna see that day;
I can feel it,
I can taste it.
Change is coming my way.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.
I'll light up the sky like lightning,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall.

I'm goin' all the way.
I can feel it, I believe it.
I'm here, I'm here to stay.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.

I'll light up the sky like lighting,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

Feel it,
Believe it,
Dream it,
Be it.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me (no, no, no)
I'll light up the sky like lighting,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh...

And this world will belong to me.

Yeah, yeah, oh...

This world will belong to me.If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (Yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Usher:]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
[Both:]
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Both:]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Both:]

I just can't wait

[Mariah Carey]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

[Mariah Carey]
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Mariah Carey]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

[Justin Bieber]
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Justin Bieber]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

[Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber:]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air

[Both]
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah

[Mariah Carey]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby (Yeahhh)
Standing right outside my door

[Both]
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you baby
Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum.
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum.
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum.
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum.
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum.
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb.
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son.
Playin' for the King, playing for the Title,
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible.
I'm so tight, I might go psycho.
Christmas time so here's a recital.
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go.
Stupid stupid love like cupid,
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it.

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum.
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum.
[Busta:]
Gather round the mistletoe real quick.
[Justin:]
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pum.
[Busta:]
Matter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here.
[Justin:]
That's fit to give our king...
[Busta:]
Bieber what up!
[Justin:]
Pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

[Busta:]
Lemme get straight to it. Yo.
At the table with the family, havin' dinner,
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker.
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer;
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter.
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger,
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla,
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool." You know I'mma deliver;
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger.
Before we work I gotta get this off,
See the other family members and drop gifts off.
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now.
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers,
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "

[Justin:]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum.
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum.
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum.
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

If you wanna give, it's the time of year.
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare.
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care,
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair.
It's about time for you to act merrily;
It's about time for you to give to charity.
Rarely do people even wanna help at all,
'Cause they're warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls.
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold.
So I think some of you need to act bold;
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe.

Globe globe globe globe globe.
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
It's a holiday (yeah, yeah yeah)
Spend it with you baby.
I think that I'm in love this Christmas. (yeah)
Just hang your stockings on the fire place.
You know that Santa's coming to town.
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh right now.
So today is all about you baby.
The mistletoe can pull us closer that's what I'm waiting for.
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's.
So I'm entering the top of your roof, them sleigh bells is ringing.
I'll be up all night with you, them carols are singing.
Japan to Peru, baby me and you, this Christmas eve!

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas eve!
Be my holiday, my dream!
(lay your head on me)
I got you baby!
Kissing underneath the tree,
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need!
Let me give you all of me, here
Together on this Christmas eve...

You leave some cookies out,
Imma eat em all.

To north pole, is that cold?
If you wanna go!

Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight

You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pindrop
Cept for the clock on the wall

And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
I'll be waiting

Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight

I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty, but just scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it when people say you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cuz hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
It's only right that...

[Bieber]

The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could this be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (how will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know if she feels the same?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna to keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
(doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings....
Whoa, ooh
Well, let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well, I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared at all), oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
Mmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright [2x]

Say you love me
As much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?

Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Mmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright [2x]

Ooh, baby, I know loving you ain't easy
But sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason
To call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?

If this a lesson
Then, baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you, you, you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

If I could die in your arms
I'mma make you believe, girl
That I wouldn't mind, no

Don't stop baby, no
(alright)
It's what you do to me, yeah
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, whoa, ooh-whoa
Baby, please don't go, girl
No, no, no, no
Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you loved me
We led it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me, yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah
I'd leave but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you

You're so amazing, girl you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I'd leave but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh, I,
Oh, I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright
